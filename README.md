### About
As a graduate student, I have learned the importance of conceptualizing a program before clicking “File–>New Project”. Courses in software engineering and object-oriented programming taught me strategies to produce a comprehensive product. I stress these strategies with the students I tutor. Developing sound logic and designing incremental goals are valuable skills to hone. This site will document projects I complete and interesting topics I discover as I continue learning.

In my free time I enjoy running, cooking, and working on home repairs. Whether it’s building a bookshelf or fixing a leaky faucet, I’m a DIY type of person.
